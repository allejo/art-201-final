Art 201 - Final Project
===

For my final project in my Art 201 class, I was given the task of creating a website for a project called "Music LA." So this project wouldn't be mindlessly boring, I experimented with the following:

- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io)
- [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io)
- [Kit language](http://incident57.com/codekit/help.html#kit)

Enough to say, I was satisfied with what I achieved by using a combination of this technology.
